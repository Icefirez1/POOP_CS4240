<pre class="pybox">
This document proves the order of operations for the operators "and", "or", and "not"



<strong>True or False and False</strong>
<strong>True</strong>

This conditional statement proves that "and" is operated first and "or" is after 
"And" is before because the and statement (false and false) is evaulated first where it is false then the or statement is evaluated 
where at least one of the operations are true so it evaluates to true. If the "or" statement was evaluated first then the whole thing
would be evaluated to false.



<strong>not True and False</strong>
<strong>False</strong>


<strong>not (True and False)</strong>
<strong>True</strong>

This conditional statement proves that "not" is operated first and "and" is operated next.
"not" is operated first on true then both parts are false making it all false 
if "and" was first the "and" statement would be evaluated to false then turned to true by the "not" which is simulated by the second 
set of lines
